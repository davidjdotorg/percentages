My percentages page

I'd like to start with the current date and time in my time zone and display the percentage complete.

If it is 5/16/2016 12:00:00 then I would display that the day is 50 percent over, the month is a little over 50 percent over and the year is a little under 50 percent over.

I will then add things to it like my deathdate from deathclock (something in 2041), percentage complete until all kids (Solomon) turn 18, percentage complete until next birthday, anniversary.

I am guessing that I will have to do something with PHP date objects.
